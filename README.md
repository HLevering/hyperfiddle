# Hypercrud

> client/server data interface, for composable UIs

Live demos, docs and more: http://hyperfiddle.net/ (Hyperfiddle is the Hypercrud reference app)

* Hypercrud Browser - library for **data driven UIs, as an EDN value**
* Hypercrud Client - client/server data sync, UI as a function
* Hypercrud Server - General purpose data server for [Datomic](http://www.datomic.com/)

## Why

React.js offers the View as a pure function of data, but UIs are more than views. UIs are thick applications which hydrate server data. In database applications, network data sync -- I/O -- is root source of complexity. I/O has latency, it can fail, it is asynchronous, and these concerns pervade our UIs today.

Hypercrud handles the data sync, enabling us to program our UIs as pure functions of local data: truly composable UIs. Hypercrud UIs are functions, proper functions which compose, letting us climb a rung higher on the ladder of abstraction, to the real goal: data driven UIs, as an edn value.

App-as-a-value paves the way for some seriously sophisticated application tooling.

**This entire screenshot is modeled as an edn value**. The bottom half is an editor for said edn values. The editor is itself modeled as an edn value too. [Yes it can edit itself and yes this is how we build it every day.](http://hyperfiddle.net/hyperfiddle-blog/ezpkb21haW4gbmlsLCA6cHJvamVjdCAiaHlwZXJmaWRkbGUtYmxvZyIsIDpsaW5rLWRiaWQgI0RiSWRbMTc1OTIxODYwNDU4OTQgMTc1OTIxODYwNDU0MjJdLCA6cXVlcnktcGFyYW1zIHs6ZW50aXR5ICNEYklkWzE3NTkyMTg2MDQ2MjA3IDE3NTkyMTg2MDQ1ODgyXX19)

Facebook is not built in hyperfiddle, but if it was, here is how we might break it down:

## Library, framework or platform?

Hypercrud is 90% library for UI, like Om Next or Reagent. The last 10% is the I/O interface, and our Datomic reference implementation. The I/O runtime is general purpose, contains no application logic, and has a client piece and a server piece. The server runtime is just a server process that you run colocated with your Datomic installation (you provide Datomic).

Hypercrud is not really a framework, because it's just pure functions and an interface, you can replace any of the pieces, and provide your own implementation of the I/O interface.

Warning! To achieve the optimal level of performance that this project is designed to achieve, your I/O runtime implementation will need deep coordination with your applications entrypoint code, and other infrastructure like database, nginx, web server, CDN. Let's call this infrastructure, your **application engine**.

    Application engine = I/O runtime implementation + infrastructure to make it fast

More about this later in this document.

<http://hyperfiddle.net/> is our reference app, and reference I/O runtime implementation backed by Datomic. The hyperfiddle cloud runtime also integrates with cloud infrastructure such as <https://auth0.com/>, scaling, server side rendering, caching & CDN. You should use this until you outgrow it, and then eject your app and selfhost for total control.

At a high level, you will have a few ways to approach your app engine:

* use <http://hyperfiddle.net/> and don't think about it until later
* self-host the same application engine that hyperfiddle.net uses (e.g. run our docker containers with your API keys)
* Use our I/O runtime but fork our application engine, to control things like auth, security, caching
* Write your own I/O runtime and application engine

No matter your choice of app engine, the Hypercrud core interface will work, Hypercrud Browser will work, and app as an edn value will work.

## Status

<http://hyperfiddle.net/>, our reference app & cloud platform, works great. The UI will evolve over time but the core interfaces are pretty baked.

In a few weeks, you will be able to run hypercrud outside of hyperfiddle.net as outlined above. We're working on that right now. To be notified when it is ready, subscribe to the developer mailing list: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypercrud>

## Hypercrud's fundamental interface is two functions

Hypercrud apps export two functions: a Reagent view expression, and a request function. The request function encodes the precise, total data dependencies of an entire page, recursively.

Here is the simplest possible Hypercrud app, a blog:

```clojure
(def request-blog
  (->QueryRequest '[:find ?post :where [?post :post/title]]
                  {"$" #DbVal[:samples-blog]}
                  {"?post" [#DbVal[:samples-blog] ['*]]}))

(defn request [state peer]
  [request-blog])
```

The hydrated response looks like this:

```clojure
[{"?post" {:db/id #DbId[17592186045419 17592186045786], :post/title "First blog post"}}
 {"?post" {:db/id #DbId[17592186045420 17592186045786], :post/title "Second blog post"}} ... ]
```

The hydrated response value is passed into the view function. Since the data is already fetched, this function is synchronous.

```clojure
(defn view [state peer dispatch!]
  (-> (let [result @(hc/hydrate peer request-blog)]     ; synchronous
        [:ul
         (->> result
              (map (fn [relation]
                     (let [post (get relation "?post")]
                       [:li {:key (:db/id post)}
                        (:post/title post)]))))])))
```

![](http://i.imgur.com/zwoGq2I.png)

If the data isn't already fetched, `hc/hydrate` returns an error value. The runtime will manage the lifecycle of these functions. It is up to your choice of runtime as to the details of this lifecycle, for example, do you want to call the view function when the data is only partially loaded? You can do that if you want. Hyperfiddle.net does this and draws loading components and reports database errors appropriately. Your runtime doesn't have to do that, it's up to you.

## The incuded Datomic I/O runtime

We provide an I/O runtime implementation that aggressively hydrates data through Datomic. When the database changes, or the request changes, we rehydrate all queries on the page through datomic. So if just a single field blurs, we rehydrate all queries on the page.

In this gif, the popover is a speculative database branch. The first branch is discarded, the second is merged. And then we throw it all away without transacting it. See [datomic api: d/with](http://docs.datomic.com/clojure/#datomic.api/with)

![](http://i.imgur.com/hRXI1p7.gif)

Isn't that slow? **No. Our unusual architecture choices make it fast.**

Well, back it up. If you use this I/O runtime in a traditional client/server REST-like configuration, where the browser makes HTTP requests to the server, it will be horrible! (Hyperfiddle.net in some circumstances does this today - so you can feel the lag - we haven't bothered to optimize this yet)

However, Clojure runs in many places. **If you run your application javascript in a process co-located with the datomic peer, all those network round trips drop out.** Hyperfiddle.net's infrastructure handles this - your ClojureScript code runs in a nodejs process colocated with a Datomic peer. In the future, the portions of your app code relevant to data dependencies, will run inside the datomic peer process itself. The relevant parts of Hypercrud are already written in portable clojure with this in mind, we just need to plumb together the infrastructure.

**The Hypercrud project is focused on the Composable UI outcome - we donâ€™t care as deeply about the data sync implementation, you can plug your implementation.** We know that by slamming Datomic we will get correct answers, it will be ACID, you can trust it, it will scale to real industry database applications, and it will be strictly faster than your REST or GraphQL apps of today. But there are other interesting I/O strategies which may achieve better performance tradeoffs than the Datomic Peer model, particularly reactive approaches as discussed in <http://tonsky.me/blog/the-web-after-tomorrow/>.

* Chris Small's Datsync <https://github.com/metasoarous/datsync>
* Luke Vanderbilt's FactUI <https://github.com/arachne-framework/factui>
* If you have another approach not listed here please write me!

Consider: What if reactive queries could be maintained in the CDN edge server? What if there was a proper Datomic peer in your iphone, or your home router?

Here is a /r/clojure thread which braindumps the type of things you need to think about if you want to implement a reactive I/O runtime. <https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/6rncgw/arachneframeworkfactui/>

### Datomic I/O runtime impl - data server piece

Hypercrud's server runtime is like Apache -- a general purpose server -- you don't need to change it. It is essentially just a Pedestal service around a Datomic Peer. Datomic Peer is already inches away from being a general purpose data server. There is no interesting code in the server runtime. You can implement your own server runtime, or reuse our internals, or whatever. It's all open source and a small amount of code.

#### Isnt this just Datomic Peer Server and Datomic Client API?

yeah pretty much, Datomic was still on the REST api when this started so we had to code the client, and afaik their javascript client isn't out yet. Hypercrud Server is a Datomic peer + a comm protocol + a security layer, and not much else.

#### Which performance profile - is it Datomic Peer or Datomic Client?

 Hypercrud Server is a Peer. Hypercrud Client may be, but is not constrained to be, implemented as a Datomic client. If you use Hypercrud Client core interface (view, request) without hypercrud browser, you are stuck with the Datomic client model, which is fine, but suboptimal, and re-introduces a theoretical performance problem caused by client/peer round trips. However, when you model the app as a value, you can literally transmit your app-value up to the server, and actually run the code to interpret the value inside the jvm Peer process. Optimal!

 Some of the above is on the roadmap and hasn't yet been implemented. We don't yet interpret app-values on JVM today, but we will. We can also run the entire application javascript in a nodejs environment colocated with a datomic peer. This happens in server side rendered cases, but not client side rendered cases today, but we will fix that soon so I can remove this sentence.

#### Data security

It works like Facebook "view my profile as other person" - the server restricts access to data based on who you are. Security is defined by two pure functions - a database filter predicate, and a transaction validator predicate. Both of these functions can query the database to make a decision. Datomic's distributed reads open the door for making this fast.

You can configure Hypercrud Server with your own arbitrary security predicates.

#### Why might I want to customize my server runtime?

* security
* authentication, if it isn't handled at your gateway

There aren't a lot of reasons for you to change the server runtime. It's like Apache for HTML - you just point it at Datomic and run the process. Maybe configure it with some security functions written in clojure and put on your classpath.

## Datomic application engine - UI pieces

Like calling `ReactDOM.render(<MyRootView/>, domNode)`, you'll need to provide an entrypoint which cedes control to the I/O runtime. The simplest possible implementation is to create a single state atom, construct a Hypercrud Client with the state atom and the userland `request` function, and mount Reagent to the dom with the userland `view` function. Hypercrud Client watches the state atom for changes and will fetch data as needed.

#### What concerns does an app engine handle?

nodejs engine:

* Hydrate data dependencies for a route in one request, to eliminate client/server round trips for dependent requests
* server side rendering e.g. [fork React to optimize ssr](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34728962/react-rendertostring-performance-and-caching-react-components)
* serve a mobile site with no javascript, only server rendered html
* redirects, http headers, cookies
* control caching strategy, deep coordination with nginx and smart CDN
* control authentication scheme e.g. <https://auth0.com/> or OAuth
* server session

web browser engine:

* client side rendering strategy (Reagent vs Rum or whatever)
* state atom implementation (e.g. clojure atom vs reagent reactive atom)
* initialize state from server rendered initial state
* HTML5 pushstate vs `/#!/` urls vs regular HTML links
* url and routing strategy
* server session vs local storage
* analytics and user tracking e.g. <https://segment.com/>

Much of this is already provided with the included reference application engine and as part of Hyperfiddle, but you'll eventually want to control it. We also provide the simplest possible hello world application engine as a devkit example which doesn't have any of these features - just a React UI which syncs data, no user auth or SSR or anything else. The hello world devkit is two lines of code. The Hyperfiddle application engine is about 150 loc each for nodejs and browser entrypoints, plus sophisticated caching infrastructure which takes advantage of immutability.

We haven't built a React Native app engine yet, but this is how you would do it.

# Hypercrud Browser

Hypercrud Browser navigates hypercrud app-values like a web browser navigates HTML. App-values define Pages, each Page declares his data dependencies, and Links to other Pages. Everything composes.

Interpreted app-value in a web browser, with custom renderers disabled:

![](http://i.imgur.com/f1ngGLt.png)

Same app-value but as the end user sees it, respecting renderers:

![](http://i.imgur.com/4WlmuW8.png)

Here's the raw edn app-value (truncated, here i don't show the whole thing):

```clojure
{:page/name "Sample Blog"
 :page/query "[:find ?post :in $ :where [?post :post/title]]"
 :page/dbs [{:dbhole/name "$" :dbhole/value {:database/ident "samples-blog"}}]
 :page/renderer "(fn [relations colspec anchors param-ctx] ... )"
 :page/find-elements [{:find-element/name "?post"
                       :find-element/connection {:database/ident "samples-blog"}
                       :find-element/form {:form/name "samples-blog - post"
                                           :form/field [{:field/prompt "title" :field/attribute {:attribute/ident :post/title :attribute/valueType #:db{:ident :db.type/string} :attribute/cardinality #:db{:ident :db.cardinality/one}}}
                                                        {:field/prompt "date" :field/attribute {:attribute/ident :post/date :attribute/valueType #:db{:ident :db.type/instant} :attribute/cardinality #:db{:ident :db.cardinality/one}}}
                                                        {:field/prompt "content" :field/attribute {:attribute/ident :post/content :attribute/valueType #:db{:ident :db.type/string} :attribute/cardinality #:db{:ident :db.cardinality/one}}}]}}]
 :page/links [{:link/prompt "view" :link/ident :sys-edit-?post
               :link/repeating? true
               :link/page {:db/id #DbId[17592186045791 17592186045422] :page/name "view post"}
               :link/find-element {:find-element/name "?post" :find-element/connection #:db{:id #DbId[17592186045786 17592186045422]}}}
              {:link/prompt "new" :link/ident :sys-new-?post :link/render-inline? true
               :link/page {:db/id #DbId[17592186045791 17592186045422] :page/name "view post"}
               :link/find-element {:find-element/name "?post" :find-element/connection #:db{:id #DbId[17592186045786 17592186045422]}}}]}
```

You might imagine the code to interpret an app-value to produce a view and a request, to satisfy the Hypercrud core interface. This code is called Hypercrud Browser and provided as a library:

```clojure
(def app-value { ... })

(defn view [state peer dispatch!]
  [browser/safe-ui app-value (:route state) {:dispatch! dispatch!}])

(defn request [state peer]
  ; code your own data dependencies, or let the browser figure it out from an app-value
  (browser/request app-value (:route state)))
```

Pages compose by composing their data dependencies therein (like an iframe). The page abstraction is sufficient to implement composite widgets like select options, which are themselves a page with a query and form.

If you stop and think, this is a lot how a web browser works. Web browsers are a general HTML client which navigates a graph by following links between pages; this is the design objective of REST, what HATEOAS means, and is called a fully general hypermedia client. **Hyperfiddle browses CRUD apps like web browsers browse HTML.** This core browser technology is implemented as an open-source library called Hypercrud Browser. It is a fully general hypermedia client, it solves the failure of REST, and is what makes Hyperfiddle possible. Hypercrud Browser is HATEOAS.

App-values are graph-shaped and grow to be quite large. It is natural to want to store app-values in a database, and create tooling to build these up visually and interactively, which leads us to:

# <http://hyperfiddle.net>

**Hyperfiddle** is a drop-in Datomic Console replacement, scriptable from the web browser in ClojureScript, for making sophisticated database applications.

Hyperfiddle is a WYSIWYG editor for Hyperfiddle app-values ("hyperfiddles"). Basically dev-tools for Hypercrud Browser.

![](http://i.imgur.com/v3cmewv.png)

Hyperfiddle is our reference app, because it and pushes Hypercrud in recursive ways. It forced us to converge our abstractions and data model to a total solution without any gaps. We had to shave approximately 100% of the yaks for it to even be possible.
